	// inventory of `generated/` by matching the compiler goldens against

	// per-lane suites at once. Riding the ordinal makes all of them adopt it with no
	// edit, while `scripts/e2e.mjs` pins threeWayScenarios to the literal

	// It is the first corpus scenario that does NOT emit in all six lanes - the
	// angular emitter refuses it on its global-identifier ban, recorded verbatim
	// in that lane's regenerate.ts - and, like S10, it stays out of the 6 x 9
